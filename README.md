# Agora

## Project Description

Agora is a Symfony project online voting platform based on majority rule. Groups can gather in assemblies, invite other users, and vote on topics through proposals. A campaign phase allows users to discuss proposals through the chat feature. A voting phase enables users to vote for their preferred proposal. Finally, the last phase presents the voting results for each topic.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following softwares are installed in your system:

Apache 2.4, MySql 8.3, PHP 8.3.6 (I used WampServer)

Composer

Node.js

## Installation

Cloning the GitHub repository:

Copy the git clone code

```
https://github.com/benjaminhaverbeke/Agora.git
```

Using Wamp

Clone the GitHub repository into the www directory of your Wamp installation:

Make sure Wamp is running and the Apache server is started.

## Configuring Environment Variables

Go to the project's root directory and open .env, ensure DATABASE_URL config like this:

```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:3306/agora?serverVersion=8.3.0&charset=utf8mb4"
```

## Generate Schema Database

The database schema is generated using the command:

```
php bin/doctrine orm:schema-tool:create
```

## Installing PHP Dependencies

Go to the project's root directory and install PHP dependencies via Composer:
```
composer install
```
update dependencies
```
composer update
```
## Installing JavaScript Dependencies

Go to the project's root directory and install JavaScript dependencies via yarn:

```
yarn install
```

## Running the Project

Ensure that Wamp is running and the Apache server is started. 

Open your web browser and navigate to
http://localhost/your-project-directory.

## Troubleshooting
Wamp Issues: Ensure that no other programs are using the same port as Apache (usually port 80). Composer Issues: Make sure you have the latest version of Composer installed. Node.js Issues: Ensure that Node.js and yarn are correctly installed and their versions are up to date.
